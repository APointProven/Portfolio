> ### About
Let the viewer learn *about* you on the "About" section, where you can place information that you believe would help you stand out to others, whether personal or professional.<br><br>

> ### Experience
Display your *experience* in the "Experience" section, whether that be the different web development languages, design programs, and more via the application logo and title.<br><br>

> ### Projects
Show off your most recent works in the "Projects" section of the website by creating a new card for each project you would like to display. The cards contain an image to preview your project along with a "view" button that links to it.<br><br>

> ### Contact
On the "Contact" page, you're able to set up receiving forms in any way you like whether that's directly through email or through a HTML form handling service.
